Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a business (subscription-based services). 

Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. The analysis aims to identify patterns and key factors influencing customer churn. By using machine learning algorithms and data exploration techniques, this project predicts which customers are likely to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Objective
Predict customer churn: Build a model to identify customers who are at risk of leaving the company.
Understand churn drivers: Identify factors that influence customer churn.
Provide actionable insights: Generate strategies to help businesses retain customers and reduce churn.

Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customers, such as:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Demographics: Customer information like age, gender, and location.
Subscription Plan: Type of subscription the customer has.
Customer Service Interactions: Data related to interactions with customer service (e.g., number of complaints, contact frequency).
Billing Information: Payment methods, billing cycle, and history.
Churn Status: Whether the customer has churned (binary: Yes/No).
Tenure: Duration the customer has been with the company.
Usage Patterns: Features related to how customers use the service (e.g., product usage, data consumption).
Key Steps in the Analysis

1. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values: Missing data in the dataset are imputed or removed based on the significance.
Categorical encoding: Categorical features (e.g., gender, subscription plan) are encoded to numeric formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature scaling: Scaling continuous variables (e.g., age, tenure) using normalization or standardization.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the central tendency, spread, and distribution of the data.
Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps) to identify patterns and relationships between features.
Churn Distribution: Analyze churn distribution across different customer attributes (e.g., plan type, tenure).

3. Feature Engineering
New features: Based on insights from the EDA, new features may be created (e.g., "customer satisfaction index" based on the number of complaints).
Interaction terms: Create features that represent the interaction between different variables (e.g., tenure and plan type).

This Customer Churn Analysis project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting customer churn. By using machine learning techniques and data-driven insights, businesses can proactively manage customer retention and improve overall business performance. The ultimate goal is to reduce churn by identifying customers at risk and implementing targeted retention strategies.
